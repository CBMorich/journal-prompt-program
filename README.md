## Project Goal
A simple program to return a random journal prompt. The user can journal and add their responses will be dated and added to a text file.

This is to practice some basic python skills in practice.

## Note
This program outputs to a text file in the local directory called 'responses.txt'. You'll need to make your own copy of this file. 

## Future Upgrades
While I probably won't plan on doing too much more to this, here are some things I might try add in the future.
- build a GUI using tkinter - I don't know how to do this yet.
- some of my functions use variable names that also exist outside of them. I'm guessing I probably shoulnd't do that.
