## Project Goal
A simple program to return a random journal prompt. The user can journal and add their responses will be dated and added to a text file.

This is to practice reading and writing from files. 

## Note
This program outputs to a text file in the local directory called 'responses.txt'. You'll need to make your own copy of this file.
